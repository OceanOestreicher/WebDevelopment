Review:  I took it before wrITING THIS REVIEW AND IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNED ON CAPS-LOCK WITHOUT ME EVEN TOUCHING IT. THE ONLY
COLOR I SEE NOW ARE SHADES OF RED. I TOOK THIS SUPPLEMENT BEFORE GOING TO THE GYM AND GOT HALFWAY THERE BEFORE I REALIZED I FORGOT MY CAR. ORDER NOW
OR I WILL ORDER IT FOR YOU.
