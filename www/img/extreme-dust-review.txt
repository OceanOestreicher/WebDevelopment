Description: Extreme dust was formulated from the dried and powdered form of real gorilla DNA.
The gorilla DNA splice is a popular product but did not have the accessibility for the general
public due to its injection mode of usage. This supplement is the drink form, which is less
potent, but does not require any needles. This product uses DNA extracted from the healthiest
gorillas of central Africa. This product provides gorilla-like grip strength and optimum
banana peeling genetics.

Review: 20 minutes after drinking this, my fingers began to expand and darken. The hair on my
fingers lengthened, and my entire body became covered in a carpet of dark black hair. I
instantly felt my muscles start to itch and impulsively let out a giant roar like that of
an African gorilla. Immediately I ran into the kitchen on all fours and ate a banana, then
ran to the gym (on all fours) and deadlifted twice my previous best. The other gym goers
were horrified. Animal Control was called. I am currently writing this from my cage.
The effects subsided, and now I am chilling with the other gorillas. They have accepted me as
their own now. 10/10, would double my deadlift and get shot with a tranquilizer again.
