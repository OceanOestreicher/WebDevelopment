Description: Carefully crafted at 99.1% purity using a patented process invented by professor
Heisenberg, this ultra-pure formula increases energy levels ten-fold. Some would say
it's the bomb. In a distinct blue shade, which comes from the chemical reaction,
is caused by a methylamine reduction. This extract allows for the neural inhibitors to
temporarily shut down, and allow for an increased amount of energy flow. Furthermore,
it relaxes the muscles in the arteries to allow them to open up, and allow for higher
blood flow. At last, it dilutes and ultra-saturates the blood with oxygen, for optimum
delivery. Side effects may include a strong desire for a meal at a certain Chicken Brothers
restaurant.
