Description: Nuclear Garbage is 100% nuclear precipitation from the Chernobyl disaster. Extracted
naturally from the top soil in Pripyat, this radioactive dust has been known to increase
strength to super-mutant levels. It also increases energy levels to the same amount that
reactor 4 output on April 26, 1986. These particles can have minor side-effects such as
growing extra limbs or cancerous tumours. This formula was based on Nuclear Lite which used
shavings off the elephant foot underneath reactor 4, but the flavor was not to our standards.
Comes in the citrus fusion flavor, which uses real Ukrainian lemons. No refunds.
