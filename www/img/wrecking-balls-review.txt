Description: Using the shavings of demolition wrecking balls found on demolition sites,
the iron content is known to bond with other organic material in your blood, to form a natural
testosterone. This product is an alternative to a synthetic type of testosterone supplement,
and is all natural. For an added boost, we have included lead paint chips which add excellent
flavor and are known to strengthen your bones and cartilage. This process works by replacing
the calcium found naturally in foods, with lead which has a higher density which means
it is stronger. In order to reduce the risk of choking, we have pulverized the entire mixture.
Best when mixed with milk or other white liquids. DO NOT GIVE TO CHILDREN UNDER 35.
