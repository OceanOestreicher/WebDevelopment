					<p class="about-us-text">Alpha Xpress was founded in 1991 by Charles Jenkins and Montgomery Harrison. During the summer of 1988, Charles was attending the University of Colorado to study pharmaceutical medicine. There, he meant Harrison who, at the time, was training to be a professional bodybuilder. Throughout school, Harrison found it harder to keep up with his fitness regime while studying law. Jenkins sought out a way to help Harrison in any way he could and on his 
					way to his classes, he found a magazine that had an ad for “muscle enhancers”. Charles gave them to Montgomery to try and help keep his friend's dream alive. From then on, Harrison was not able to just keep up his figure, but able to reach new heights. All this, while attending law school.

					<p class="about-us-text">During the spring of 1993, Charles graduated college and immediately began his business 
					venture expanding Alpha Xpress beyond the shabby campus. He started by enlisting his friend Gerry Lang, a computer science student, to help build a website for Alpha Xpress. Jenkins believed that the world wide web could help expand Alpha beyond just the state while not breaking the bank. Throughout the 1990s, Alpha Xpress would slowly grow into an underground hit, selling many of its stable products like “bull testicle supplements”.

					<p class="about-us-text">Now, Alpha Xpress is a leading company in providing “safe” and “ethical” 
					gym supplements and injections to millions of customers. Throughout the early 2000s, Dwyane “The Rock” Johnson became a key proponent of Alpha’s services.

					<i>“Alpha Express changed my life. I struggled with juggling my career as a WWE wrestler while trying to break into Hollywood. I met with Harrison during the spring of 2001 and he is one of the best men I’ve met in my life. He changed me after recommending there products. it’s like I can’t go a day in my life now without Alpha Xpress’ Products. It’s a way of life.”</i> - Dwayne Johnson, 2011
