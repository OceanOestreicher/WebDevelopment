				<p><i>"Growing up, I was a skinny nerd. No one wanted to give me the time of the day. Always last picked. No girl wanted to be within 20 feet of me. Heck, no one wanted to be with me. It really hit my confidence. Hard to go outside and be judged for my looks; even harder to stay inside where I was left to rot. After ordering Crack, I can say with 100% conviction that my life has improved. I’ve become way more confident in myself and I guess people took notice and now getting attention and friends is so much easier. My physical appearance maybe hasn’t changed as much, but my brain and personality have been dialed up to 1000%."</i> - <strong>Bryan, Newark, New Jersey, Age 47.</strong>

			<h1> Memories You'll Never Forget</h1>

				<p><i>"I started buying from Alpha in 2016. I remember I was so hyped to finally get my hands on the products. It had been over a year since Harrison announced that they would start internally shipping to Europe. My mates and I ended up pitching together a couple of pounds to get one of each product. All I remember is that we tried each product and then I woke up two days later with a splitting headache. But man… the photos were sick. After that, I’ve been a regular user of Alpha’s products."</i> - <strong>Edward, Chichester, United Kingdom, Age 24</strong>

				<p><i>"I’m going to real with ya, I didn’t think that Alpha’s products would be good. My uncle told me about how he and my dad used to order “Mighty Mushrooms” off of Alpha’s website back in the 90s. My dad, ordering dubious supplements off the internet… if only he were like that now. Anyway, I ordered some “Dust Extreme” last month. I gotta be honest, it doesn’t come close to my strawberry vape pods but it did give me a nice kick.  I’d rate it. Use it regularly after a workout so I can function normally for the rest of the day."</i> Hehehe - <strong>Davey, Jordan Valley, Oregon, Age 17</strong>
